/**
 * Thoribio
 * A Multiplatform SDK library for building unidirectional architectures that
 * rely on coroutines for high performance concurrency.
 *
 * The library provides several key interfaces to define the components of an
 * unidirectional architecture, including:
 *
 * - DTO: A Data Transfer Object interface to define data objects that are
 * passed from the model to the service.
 *
 * - Action: An interface to define actions that are dispatched from the view
 * and handled by the feature.
 *
 * - State: An interface to define the state of the feature.
 *
 * - Service: A functional interface to define a service that handles an action
 * and returns a state.
 *
 * - Repository: A functional interface to define a repository that handles an
 * action and returns a DTO.
 *
 * - ActionDispatcher: A functional interface to define an action dispatcher
 * that dispatches an action to a service.
 *
 * - StateReducer: A functional interface to define a state reducer that reduces
 * an action and the current state to produce a new state.
 *
 * - SideEffect: A functional interface to define a side effect handler that
 * can be executed alongside a state reducer.
 *
 * - Feature: An interface to define a feature that contains a service, an
 * action dispatcher, and a state reducer. It also has methods for sending
 * actions, accessing the state, and cancelling and joining the coroutines.

     * In computer science, an operation, function or expression is said to have
     * a side effect if it modifies some state variable value(s) outside
     * its local environment, which is to say if it has any observable effect
     * other than its primary effect of returning a value to the invoker of the
     * operation. Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable,
     * modifying a static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed
     * by reference, performing I/O or calling other functions with
     * side-effects.
     * In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on
     * history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and
     * debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the
     * context and its possible histories.
